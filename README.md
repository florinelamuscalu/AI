## Word complexity
  The project is about sorting words according to their complexity. For the project I used 2 algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes (Gaussian).
  In order to be able to classify the words, I created several functions according to certain characteristics of the words such as: the number of syllables, the number of vowels, the length of a word and compound words with hyponyms and hypernyms.
